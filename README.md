# Concrete Strength Prediction Project

This repository contains a two-part project aimed at predicting concrete strength using various machine learning models and extensive data exploration. The project is divided into two Jupyter notebooks, with each notebook focusing on different aspects of the analysis and modeling process.

## Overview

The project is focused on analyzing the factors that influence concrete strength and predicting it using machine learning models. In the first notebook, a detailed analysis is performed, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation. The second notebook is a more concise version aimed at comparing several machine learning models to determine the most effective one for concrete strength prediction.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains various mixture compositions for concrete and their corresponding strength values. Key factors include water content, curing time, and other mixture components, which influence the overall strength of the concrete.

## Notebooks

### 1. Detailed Analysis Notebook
This notebook focuses on:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, correlation matrix, and visualizations such as scatter plots and histograms.
- **Concrete Strength Analysis**: Investigating the influence of age, water content, and other mixture compositions on strength.
- **Regression Analysis**: Multiple regression models, including standardization of features, interaction terms, and model comparisons.
- **Decision Trees and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploration of decision tree models and tuning with cross-validation.

This notebook is intended to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset and the factors influencing concrete strength.

### 2. Model Comparison Notebook
This more compact notebook focuses on:
- Implementing and comparing multiple machine learning models for concrete strength prediction.
- Models included: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, ANN and others.
- Performance metrics and comparison
